Wine tasting is an art since decades. The main purpose of this study is to predict wine quality based on physicochemical data. These data sets contain around 1600 instances for red wine with 11 features of physicochemical data such as alcohol, chlorides, density, total sulfur dioxide, free sulfur dioxide, residual sugar, and pH. The following five different algorithms were used to classify the quality of red wine: random forests, support vector machines, naïve bayes, logistic regression and decision tree. There are 3 quality classes of red wine. The most successful classification was obtained by using Naïve Bayes Algorithm with 99.25 accuracy rate. In this study, it is also observed that the use of principal component analysis in the feature selection increases the success rate of classification in Naïve Bayes Algorithm
